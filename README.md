# 💳 Credit Card Transaction Analysis
Analyzed real-world credit card transaction data to uncover spending behavior across cities, card types, and customer segments.


## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores **credit card transaction data** to uncover key insights about customer spending behavior, city-level trends, and business patterns.  
Using **SQL, Python, I performed an end-to-end analysis — from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to deriving actionable business insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goal was to transform raw transaction data into meaningful insights that can drive **data-informed decisions** for banks, financial institutions, and retail partners.

## 🧠 Key Questions Solved

1 write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends.

2 write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type.

3 write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type).

4 write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type.

5 write a query to print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel).

6 write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type.

7 which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014.

9 during weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio.    */
